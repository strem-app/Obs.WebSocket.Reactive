# Obs.WebSocket.Reactive

This repository is mainly here to support the Strem app but can be used by anyone really.

It builds on top of the existing obs websocket library (v4) and adds a reactive layer on to be notified on changes rather than using events.

There are 3 repos:

- `Obs.v4.WebSocket` - The base v4 websocket branch taken from [https://github.com/Zingabopp/obs-websocket-dotnet](https://github.com/Zingabopp/obs-websocket-dotnet)
- `Obs.v4.WebSocket.Reactive` - The reactive wrapper around the v4 websocket
- `Obs.v5.WebSocket.Reactive` - The reactive wrapper around the v5 [websocket library](https://github.com/BarRaider/obs-websocket-dotnet)
